# Decomposing-Time-Series
Try it 10.1: Decomposing Time Series
This activity fouses on exploring two different time series and the decomposed elements. The example of sunspots data is given as well as a dataset containing air passenger information through the twentieth century in the United States. These are both time series datasets however there is a distinct difference in the nature of the time series.

Below, you are to use the statsmodels function seasonal_decompose to show how the trend and seasonality of the series differ in (perhaps) expected ways. To begin, you are to make sure the datasets contain an appropriate time stamp index -- statsmodels expects this. Then, use the seasonal_decompose function to decompose the series into trend and seasonality. Examing plots of these elements, and discuss the similarities and differences between these components for the two time series.
